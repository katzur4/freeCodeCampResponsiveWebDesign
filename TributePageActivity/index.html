                <li><span class="bold">Frost Arrows</span> -Adds a freezing effect to Drow's attacks, slowing enemy movement and dealing bonus damage. Slow lasts 1.5 seconds.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Gust</span> -Releases a wave that silences and knocks back enemy units. Knockback distance is relative to how close they are to Drow. Drow gains Movement Speed for the same duration.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Multishot</span> -Drow releases a flurry of arrows in continuous salvos, hitting enemies for extra damage and applying longer duration Frost Arrows. Lasts up to 1.75 seconds.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Glacier</span> -Drow Ranger creates a hill of ice beneath her. While standing on the hill, attackers gain bonus attack range and high ground advantage - they cannot miss and gain flying vision. Drow Ranger additionally gets bonus Multishot arrows per wave while on the hill. The front of the hill obscures vision and cannot be moved through except by Drow Ranger.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Marksmanship</span> -Drow's experiences in battle grant her a chance to launch arrows with incredible accuracy and effectiveness. Pierces through the enemy's defenses, ignoring their base armor. Grants Drow and nearby ranged heroes with bonus agility based on Drow's current agility. This ability is disabled if there is an enemy hero within 400 range.</li>
